## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Street Views (~2 days)
First thing I need is a Backbone View to show individual street view. It will talk to Google Maps JavaScript API and create `StreetViewPanorama` objects. Url will look like "/v/22.43805_114.097445_12.38_-5_0" â€“ Four sets of numbers, each of them representing latitude, longitude, heading and pitch. Root page will redirect to random panorama page. I will also push to Heroku.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: User Authentication and Displaying Galleries and Pano Items (~2 days)
I will implement user authentication in Rails. And I will add API routes to serve user and gallery data as JSON, then add Backbone models and collections that fetch data from those routes. I will make Backbone views to show users, galleries and their items.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: Creating/Editing/Deleting Galleries and PanoItems (~2 days)
Users will be able to create galleries and save individual `StreetViewPanorama` objects as `panoItem` backbone model object, then `pano_item` ActiveRecord object. When logged in, user will be able to edit and delete their own galleries and pano items. Tags should be handled as well.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: Searching for Galleries and PanoItems (~2 days)
I'll need a `search` route that accepts a query in the params. The controller action will run two queries: one to find galleries where the `title` matches  the search term, and another to find pano items where one of their associated `Tag`s matches the search term. In Backbone, I plan to implement a `SearchResults` view that will display matching galleries in one column and matching pano items in another.

[Details][phase-four]
